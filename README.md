## Features

### Mini Transponder gauge

An unobtrusive mouse-driven transponder gauge, giving you the ability to always have a "mode C" capable transponder with IDENT functionality on any airplane/model that you use.

The gauge is hidden by default and activated by moving your mouse to the **bottom right corner** of your monitor: the gauge then appears and you can **change your squawk code** by mousing over the individual digits and rotating the mouse wheel up or down.
